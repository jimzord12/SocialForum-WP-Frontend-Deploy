This Web Application is only a part of the Genera's official website. You can check it out by going: [here](https://life-genera.eu/index.php/forum-undec-dev/)
<br />
<br />

## Technologies

The **Genera's main website** was developed using the **WordPress** web framework, this is the reason why the Social Forum was built quite differently when compared with the rest of the Genera's Social Platform's Web Services.

Eschewing the use of modern web frameworks like React, I opted for a more foundational approach to web development for this project. Specifically, **I utilized the building blocks of the web** (listed below) to serve as the core technologies used.
<br />
<br />

<br />

However, given the nature of this project as a **Decentralized Application (DApp)**, and to improve the **Developer Experience (DX)**, I incorporated several modules. These modules are designed to streamline the coding process and facilitate efficient communication between the application's User Interface (UI) and the Blockchain Network's Smart Contracts, enhancing both the developer's workflow and the application's functionality.

- **TailWind CSS** (A utility-first CSS framework packed with predefined classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup)
- **Flowbite** (Flowbite is an open-source UI component library built on top of Tailwind CSS and based on the Flowbite Design System)
- **Ethers.js** (A JS Library, that is required in order to connect the app with the blockchain)

- **MetaMask** (A crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain apps, available as a browser extension and mobile app, primarily used for interacting with Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps).)

## Website Guide

Once you visit the website, you will be greeted with the page presented in top of this document.

By clicking on any Post (currently available are: "The MERN Stack" and "Most Popular Web Development Tech-Stack (2023)") you shall be navigated to the Post's page. For this tutorial, I will be choosing the: "The MERN Stack".

From there, you will be able to perform a variety of actions:
<br />

- **Consume the static contect** (in simpler terms, read the Post's text)
- **Post Voting**: Vote on the particular **Post's Content** (available options are: _"Like"_ or _"Dislike"_)
- **Comment Voting**: Vote on the particular Post's **Comments** (available options are: _"Like"_ or _"Dislike"_)
- **Comment Submission**: Sumbit a Comment expressing your views regarding the specific topic

When performing any of these actions (**_excluding_** the 1st one: _"Content Comsumption"_) you will be prompted with a pop-up window to receive a reward.

> **What is this reward?** You can check out our Rewarding Tool's documentation: [here](https://github.com/jimzord12/RewardingTool-Frontend-Deploy/tree/master#description)

For our tutorial, I will be performing the **"Comment Voting"** action.

It is as simple as clicking on any Comment's "Like" or "Dislike" button
<br />

<img src="github-readme-imgs/sf-post-comment-voting-v2.png" alt="Framer Motion" width="100%" height="100%" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />

Immediately after, a pop-up window (known as a modal) will appear.
<br />

<img src="github-readme-imgs/sf-reward-modal.png" alt="Framer Motion" width="100%" height="100%" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

As the modal window description mentions, we must **possess** (have installed as an extension) and also have **connected a crypto wallet (MetaMask) to the website**.

> **No idea what a crypto wallet even is?** You can check a short a recorded: [here (empty)](https://youtube.com/)

Futhermore, if you do not desire to get involved in this blockchain madness, you can always just close the window. This window shall not interfere with the rest of the site's provided features or functionality.

Moving forward, I will assume that you have MetaMask installed as an extension in your currently using browser. 

As we have not yet connected our crypto wallet to the website (common practice when interacting with Dapps) we can click the "Connect Now" button to let MetaMask know that we wish to connect it with the site.

> **A quick note**, if you try to obtain the Reward by clicking the "Get Reward" button without having your wallet connected, this will happen: 
<br />

<img src="github-readme-imgs/sf-error-modal.png" alt="Framer Motion" width="100%" height="100%" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

Once the "Connect Now" button is clicked, MetaMask will prompt you with a window in order to receive your blessing and start the site connecting process.

Connection Window Step: 1/2 - Select the Account you wish to be connected to the site and then click "Next".
<br />

<img src="github-readme-imgs/sf-metamask-site-connect.png" alt="Framer Motion" width="100%" height="100%" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

Connection Window Step: 2/2 - Authorize the Connection by clicking the "Connect" button.
<br />

<br />
<br />

Perfect, now our wallet is connected to the site and we can start interacting with the site's web3 features.

Now, the time has come to go and explore (a little bit) MetaMask and how the web3 cosmos works. Don't worry I will not over do it üòÅ

1. Open MetaMask
<br />

<br />
<br />

2. This window will appear
<br />

<img src="github-readme-imgs/Metamask_Config/sf-metamask-2.png" alt="Framer Motion" width="100%" height="100%" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

3. Click the three dots, as shown below
<br />

<br />
<br />

4. Now, click Expand view
<br />

<br />
<br />

5. Here I skipped a step, you must click the oval button named, in my case, "Goerli test network". In your case, it probably says "Ethereum Mainnet". Once the dropdown menu appears, click "Add network".
<br />

> **Why are even doing all of this?** This process is required because the Smart Contracts that hold the logic for the Rewarding System reside inside the GENERA Private Blockchain Network.

> **Networks Analogy**: To wrap your head around all of these different networks concept, think of each network as a separate Planet existing in the Web3 Universe. Each Planet, has its own smart contracts, its own native currency and cannot directly communicate with other Planets. 

> **Conrtacts Analogy**: Now to get a feeling of the Smart Contracts' role in this space, you can think of them as Shops that exist on these Planets. Let's say that I have developed a Smart Contract named "Jimmy's Awesome Pastry" and I deploy it (open the shop publicly) to GENERA's Network. This means, that if an user wishes to buy my insanly tasty creations, he/she will have to come to the GENERA Planet and grab these pastries. However note, that this does not stop me from creating an Pastry Empire across the whole wide Web3 Universe ü§ë. But as in the real world, every one of my Pastry Shops will be unique and probably be a little different than the others as it is on another Planet. On each Planet, the requlations, taxes, etc. may be slightly different üòâ.

> **Users Perspective Analogy**: When users interact with their Crypto Wallets by changing the network their Wallet is pointing to (as we are about to do in this tutorial) it's like they are teleporting from Planet to Planet. Depending the Planet they are currently on, their assets (digital and/or physical) will change. This is to be expected, as it is like you are in Japan and try to use Euros to pay for something. Their native currency is Yen, so your monetary assets (Euros) will not be acceptable. Futhermore, if your heart longs for the superb paste of my pastries but I have yet to establish a Shop in the Planet your assets are currently reside, you must find a way to convert/swap them for the native currency that is used in a Planet that hosts one of my Shops. This opens an exiting world of finance called DeFi, which is out the scope of this tutorial.
