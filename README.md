GENERA Project: The Platform's Social Forum Web Application
<br />
This Web Application is only a part of the Genera's official website. You can check it out by going [here](https://life-genera.eu/index.php/forum-undec-dev/)

## Technologies

The **Genera's main website** was developed using the **WordPress** web framework, this is the reason why the Social Forum was built quite differently when compared with the rest of the Genera's Social Platform's Web Services.

Eschewing the use of modern web frameworks like React, I opted for a more foundational approach to web development for this project. Specifically, **I utilized the building blocks of the web** (listed below) to serve as the core technologies used.

<br />

However, given the nature of this project as a **Decentralized Application (DApp)**, and to improve the **Developer Experience (DX)**, I incorporated several modules. These modules are designed to streamline the coding process and facilitate efficient communication between the application's User Interface (UI) and the Blockchain Network's Smart Contracts, enhancing both the developer's workflow and the application's functionality.
