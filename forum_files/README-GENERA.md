## Reward Restrictions üîê

Users should only be allowed to obtain every reward type only once, every X amount of time (ex. 8hrs) <br />
To achieve this a MySQL table is required. This table must have at least 4 columns.

- Col (1): User ID,
- Col (2): Reward Type #1 - timestamp,
- Col (3): Reward Type #2 - timestamp,
- Col (4): Reward Type #3 - timestamp,

Using these timestamps we can check if X amount of time has passed.
